# Taskinator

While going through Module 4 of bootcamp, I coded this application after reading the descriptions and following along with the code the module showed and explained to me.

## How It Works

You can create a task, pick a task type, and add it to the application.

From there, you can edit any existing tasks and change what column they go to, as well as delete a task.

The options for the task type are print, web, and mobile. And the columns are tasks to do, tasks in progress, and tasks completed.
